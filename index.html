                <p>Hi! I'm Jake. I used to be a high school teacher. But nowadays, even though I'm a Community Developer at Tailwarden I still feel like a teacher of sorts, teaching a class of one that is. I'm definitely not what you would call a "natural", it's taken me a considerable amount of effort and head-scratching to get some basic tech skills under my belt. So don't feel discouraged if you feel this way too. I've been slowly but surely giving myself enough homework and pushing myself hard enough to carve out a small space in the Open Source/Cloud/DevOps world and that's what I write about here.</p>
